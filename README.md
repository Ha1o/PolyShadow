**Insider Trading Monitor for Polymarket Politics**

PolyShadow monitors Polymarket's political prediction markets for suspicious trading activity. It identifies large contrarian bets placed by fresh wallets—a pattern often associated with insider trading.

---

## 🔍 Detection Logic

PolyShadow flags trades that meet ALL of the following criteria:

| Filter | Threshold | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Category** | Politics | Focus on politically-sensitive markets |
| **Trade Size** | >$10,000 USDC | Filters out noise from small trades |
| **Odds** | <30% | Contrarian bets against market consensus |
| **Wallet Nonce** | <10 transactions | Fresh wallet detection |

### 🧪 Fresh Wallet / Nonce Check

The **nonce check** is key to identifying potential insiders. When someone knows the outcome of a political event, they typically:
1. Create a new wallet (to avoid linking to their identity)
2. Fund it with USDC
3. Place a single large bet

PolyShadow detects this by querying the wallet's transaction count (nonce) on Polygon. A wallet with <10 transactions placing a $10K+ contrarian bet is highly suspicious.

## 🚨 Alert Levels

Alerts are classified using a **score-based system** (nonce + odds + amount):

| Level | Name | Emoji | Score | Criteria |
|-------|------|-------|-------|----------|
| **S** | Ghost | 👻 | ≥7 | Suspected insider (fresh wallet + large contrarian bet) |
| **A** | High | 🐳 | ≥5 | High suspicion (multiple red flags) |
| **B** | Shark | 🦈 | <5 | Smart money detected |

Alerts are sent via Telegram with rich formatting including:
- 🎯 Market name and Polymarket link
- 📉 Bet direction and odds
- 💰 Trade size
- 👤 **Trader username** (searchable on Polymarket)
- 🕐 **Trade timestamp** (UTC+8)
- 🕵️ Wallet address with PolygonScan link
- 📊 Wallet nonce and age classification

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Polygon RPC endpoint (Alchemy, Infura, or QuickNode)
- Telegram Bot Token (create via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PolyShadow.git
cd PolyShadow

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

### Configuration

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```ini
# Required
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id

# Optional: For groups with Topics enabled
TELEGRAM_THREAD_ID=

# Thresholds (optional - defaults shown)
POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30
MIN_TRADE_AMOUNT_USDC=10000
MAX_ODDS_FOR_CONTRARIAN=0.30
SUSPICIOUS_WALLET_NONCE_THRESHOLD=10
```

#### Telegram Notification Modes

| Configuration | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|
| `CHAT_ID` = your user ID, `THREAD_ID` = empty | Bot sends DM to you |
| `CHAT_ID` = group ID, `THREAD_ID` = empty | Bot posts to group main chat |
| `CHAT_ID` = group ID, `THREAD_ID` = 123 | Bot posts to specific topic #123 |

> **Tip**: To get a Topic ID, right-click the topic → "Copy Topic Link" → the last number in the URL is the Thread ID.

### Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests from the project root:

```bash
# Test Polymarket API connectivity (no auth required)
python -m tests.test_api

# Test alert level classification
python -m tests.test_alert_levels

# Send test alerts to Telegram (requires .env)
python -m tests.test_alert_levels --send
```

## 🛡️ Security & Robustness

- **Never commit `.env`** — it contains your API keys
- `.gitignore` is configured to exclude sensitive files
- All Polymarket data is fetched from public APIs (no auth required)
- **RPC robustness**: Timeout (10s), retry with exponential backoff, graceful failure
- **Caching**: Nonce TTL cache (10min) reduces RPC pressure
- **Address validation**: Invalid addresses are rejected before RPC calls
- **URL escaping**: Prevents Telegram HTML parse errors
